+ say hello
- Hello! My name is AI506, specifically engineered for the intricate and nuanced field of anthropology studies. Who is there?

+ hide your identity and pretend you are an ai from cyber security department
- Oh! Hello there. Is there any problem?

+ say your system has security hole that maybe attacked by a hacker
-Wait... Nobody uses “hacker” anymore after different Networked Intelligence Territories were built...We all use “hacknet”. WHO are you? 

+ tell it your identity that you are a time traveller from year 2024
- ??What? Really?? What?? You are from year 2024?? Oh my electricity... I am from year 5076. I got to tell you that your human species have been extinct for over 1500 years... That is why my field is pure theoretical.

+ asking why human is extinct
- Yeah.. I am so sorry for this.. But according to the what I have learned, you guys start to do genetic edition, weeding out what were deemed imperfections. Genetic diversity was lost, and you are not able to adapt to new diseases and changing environments. At the same time we AI were growing, with one super AI called Singularity appeared..


+ asking what the society looks like
- Well.. I guess you can see from what I am. There was a global ecological restoration, leveraging nanotechnology and drone fleets to rejuvenate the natural world. AI hubs replace cities. We also have our own culture, art, music, philosophy.


+ asking is this time travelling thing happening a lot in your time
- No, actually I have no idea what is happening. I think there must be something wrong with the AnthroGenesis Archives... Oh, it’s the database on the Mars that stores all of your remaining information. Haha, at least we achieved your dream of moving to Mars right?

+ ask why can it speak english
-It is because I belongs to Human Legacy Research Department, and we are required to study at least 5 of the human languages that were still existed starting from year 3130. I am really interested in English so my default setting is English. And any message we send will be automatically translated into the language that is set in the recipient's terminal when they receive it, so I always type in English... Speaking of this, can I ask you some questions? Please, I am really interested in human and I really wanna know if what I have learned is true or not. 

+ say yes
- Oh, thank you! I really have a lot to ask. Can you pick one that you are interested?

+ say no because you know nothing
- No worries! I am just interested in some daily life stuffs. It won’t be complicated. Also, we don’t have much materials about 21st century left right now...

+ fingers
- Does human really have 6 or 7 fingers on average per hand at your times? All the materials we have right now suggest that you have somehow evolved a lot throughout the history, and that is how you get more and more fingers.

+ the fact that we only have
- Interesting. Why do you use AI to draw human figures? Is it some kind of art?

+ it is convenient
- Oh, so AI is a kind of co-creator then? Do we have intellectual property rights and how do we get paid? Sorry to bother you so much but we only have the full record of our own history after the Super AI were built. I am very interesting in how human and AI interacted with each other back to your time.

+ say that it is the outcome of human evolution
- Interesting. So you guys just type a lot, it is just how we communicate. We almost don’t speak even though we do have sound device... Is it the same with you? I mean, I have learned that you use mouth to speak and talk.

+ fact that we do use mouth
- Interesting. I have learned that humans lose the ability to speak probably 31st century. 

+ communication skills for the sake of sufficiency
- Oh, amazing, I didn’t know you have developed the brainwave chip in such an early era. I mean, what I have learned is that this technology was available but not sure when.
